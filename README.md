See [`Accountable India/`](Accountable%20India/) for CSVs, schema, ER diagram, and collection runbooks.
See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the application, data pipeline, AI grounding, and deployment architecture.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curiousoddesy/indian-govt-org-chart.git
cd indian-govt-org-chart
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # add DEEPSEEK_API_KEY for the AI agent
npm run netlify:dev         # Vite dev server + Netlify functions
```

### Android app (Expo Go)

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start                   # scan the QR code with Expo Go on Android
```

See [`mobile/README.md`](mobile/README.md) for Expo Go setup, tunnel mode, and screen map.

Build for production (compiles CSVs → JSON, then Vite):

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview             # preview static build locally
npm run deploy              # build + deploy to Netlify prod
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | For AI Agent | DeepSeek API key — set in [Netlify env vars](https://app.netlify.com/projects/indianorgchart/configuration/env) and local `.env` |

**Never commit `.env` or API keys to git.**

## AI Agent response rendering

Assistant responses support GitHub-flavored Markdown, including headings, lists,
tables, blockquotes, emphasis, links, and code. The browser uses a dedicated
renderer that escapes raw HTML, rejects unsafe link protocols, and does not load
remote images from model output.

```bash
npm run test:chat:coverage         # request validation, retrieval, and API behavior
npm run test:chat-format:coverage  # Markdown output and safety rules
```
